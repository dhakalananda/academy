## Introduction

[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg) is a powerful, flexible, and highly customizable open-source content management system (CMS) used to build everything from personal blogs to large enterprise applications. It is built on PHP and typically uses a MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL database. Known for its robustness and scalability, Drupal powers a wide range of high-traffic and mission-critical websites, including government portals, universities, and large organizations.

Drupal was initially released in 2001 by Dries Buytaert and has since grown into a mature platform maintained by a global community of contributors.

## Drupal Ecosystem

The Drupal ecosystem is extensive and goes beyond the core CMS. Drupal provides thousands of contributed modules and themes that extend functionality and customize the appearance of Drupal websites. Similar to WordPress, it can be customised without having to type a single line of code.

Drupal goes beyond modules and themes i.e, Distributions. It is a collection of specific modules, themes and configurations packaged into one available for installation.

- **Core** - The CMS itself
- **Modules** - An additional piece of software that can be installed on a Drupal website to extend its functionality and add new features
- **Themes** - An additional piece of software that represents the visual appearance and layout of a Drupal site
- **Distributions** - A full Drupal package including core, modules, themes, and configuration tailored for a specific purpose (e.g., Open Social, Drupal Commerce Kickstart)

#### Drupal Modules

[Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module) is a piece of software that adds new features or enhances existing functionality on a Drupal site. Modules can introduce everything from SEO improvements and security tools to CRM integrations, eCommerce capabilities, API layers, or workflow systems. Modules are tightly integrated with the Drupal hook system and plugin architecture, allowing deep customization.

As of writing this article, there are more than fifty-four thousands free and open-source Drupal modules available on the [official Drupal repository](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module). There are a lot of premium modules that are available independently as well.

#### Drupal Themes

Drupal themes control the site's appearance, layout, and front-end styling. They determine how content is rendered to the end user and influence user experience and branding.

Themes can be installed and managed easily from the Drupal admin interface, and Drupal's Twig-based templating system provides flexibility for developers who want complete control over HTML structure and styling.

As of writing this article, there are more than three thousands free and open-source Drupal themes available on the [official Drupal repository](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme/). Similar to modules, premium themes are avaialble to buy as well.

#### Drupal Distributions

Drupal distributions are pre-packaged, ready-to-use versions of Drupal that include Drupal core, along with a curated set of modules, themes, and preconfigured settings designed to serve a specific type of website or application. Instead of starting from a blank Drupal installation, distributions provide a structured foundation tailored for particular use cases.

As of writing this article, there are around than 1500 free and open-source Drupal distributions available on the [official Drupal repository](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_distribution/).
